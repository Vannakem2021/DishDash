## Current Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the authentication flow, particularly for guest users. Key areas of work include:

1. **Authentication Improvements**

   - Implementing a clear distinction between guest and authenticated users
   - Adding proper restrictions for guest users
   - Ensuring consistent login prompts across the application

2. **Bug Fixes**

   - Addressing issues with user session management
   - Fixing guest user restrictions in the cart and profile screens
   - Resolving edge cases in the authentication flow

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Improving login and registration flows
   - Adding proper visual feedback during authentication
   - Creating consistent user experience across different user states

## Recent Changes

1. **Authentication Flow Enhancement**

   - Implemented "Continue as Guest" option in the login screen
   - Added guest user detection throughout the application
   - Created proper authentication checks in various screens
   - Implemented login prompts for restricted features

2. **UI Improvements**

   - Updated cart screen to show login prompt for guest users
   - Enhanced food detail screen with proper authentication checks
   - Updated profile screen to handle guest vs authenticated users
   - Added login dialogs when guests attempt restricted actions

3. **Session Management**
   - Improved session validation and persistence
   - Added better logging for session state
   - Enhanced guest user session handling
   - Implemented proper session cleanup during logout

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Refinement**

   - Add more robust error handling throughout authentication flow
   - Implement better feedback for authentication state changes
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all screens that require authentication

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Optimize session checks to reduce redundant operations
   - Improve state management for authentication
   - Add caching for frequently accessed user data

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Enhance visual feedback during authentication processes
   - Implement smoother transitions between authenticated and guest states
   - Add clearer messaging about capabilities for different user types

## Active Decisions

1. **Guest User Implementation**

   - Decision: Use a dedicated guest user in the database with email 'guest@example.com'
   - Rationale: Allows consistent identification and handling of guest users
   - Implementation: Create and maintain a guest user entry in the users table

2. **Authentication Flow**

   - Decision: Implement consistent "Login Required" prompts across the application
   - Rationale: Ensures users understand why certain actions are restricted
   - Implementation: Add authentication checks before cart operations and profile access

3. **Session Management**
   - Decision: Enhance session validation with more detailed checks
   - Rationale: Prevents edge cases where session state becomes inconsistent
   - Implementation: Add comprehensive validation in SessionManager
